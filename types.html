     <h2>Domestic Short-Haired Cats</h2><br>
     <img src="domesticshort.jpg" alt="" width="500px" height="500px">
    <p>Domestic long-haired cats have long and fluffy fur that can grow several inches. Because of their long coat, they need brushing more often to prevent knots and tangles. They are also found in many colors and styles since they are also mixed breeds. These cats look very soft and beautiful, and people like them because of their cute and furry appearance. However, they shed more hair compared to short-haired cats. Long-haired cats are usually calm and enjoy staying inside the house.</p>

    <img src="pu.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Purebred cats are cats that belong to a specific breed, such as Persian, Siamese, Bengal or Maine Coon. These cats have certain features that make them different from normal mixed cats. For example, Persian cats have long hair and flat faces, while Siamese cats have slim bodies and blue eyes. Bengal cats look a bit like small tigers. Purebred cats usually have a known family history, and people choose them for their special look or behavior. They need more care and can be more expensive compared to other cats.</p>
